# Just a simple api for Romania corona data

The APIs will be available on [valipank.ro](http://valipank.ro) and also on [pank.go.ro](http://pank.go.ro) (as a sort-of-a backup)

In a near future I'd like also to implement a swagger-like documentation for the exposed APIs.

Be patient - I'm learning also PHP in order to expose dynamic content (from a MariaDB data base).
In the first version of the APIs (v1) I'll use direct call to php pages with GET parameters.
( _I'm learnign how to do it in the proper way_  - fine looking URIs)

Please feel free to suggest anything that might be usefull.
